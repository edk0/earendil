This is the beginnings of a Python irc bot framework. But that's not the interesting part.

The interesting part is in `codegen/messages.desc`, which is a
human-readable description of the IRC protocol. Using
`codegen/compile.py`, you can compile this description into a
machine-readable JSON description and a hyperlinked documentation
website.
